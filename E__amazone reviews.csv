0,Ravneet Kaur,Excellent Book. Great for last minute help too,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 2 December 2016,"  Excellent Book. Great for last minute help too. But will give best results if bit-by-bit progress is made regularly with the book for 3-4 months.Pros:It is not just any other aptitude book. Rather, Tailor-made for the CSIR-NET exam pattern. Most books in the market lack this.All frequently appearing concepts of exam have been discussed in details, followed by relevant examples to understand the application of the formulas/techniques. And along with it, solved CSIR NET questions from that concept.Very well-explained solutions.Very student-friendly. Useful information has been given, which helps student to know which are more frequently asked concept areas. Also the book helps in identifying the difficult and/or time-taking problems, which are better to be avoided in exam.Cons: None. But it would be better if questions of the latest paper are also segregated chapter-wise.Overall, a great buy. A must buy. No matter you are strong at aptitude or weak, it will prove to be very helpful in both cases."
1,Chandrashekar,Excellent book for apti.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2016,  First book for aptitude which I saw teaches real skill one must develop to solve any type of math problem. If this book can be combined with Quantitative aptitude by Varun Gupta one would become master in this area.All the top rated famous books under this category couldn't teach the real skill which is generic to solve any type of apti problem. But these two books differ in this aspect. Amazing writing style. To the point explanations. One cannot be failed in apti if he/she could learn and practice by using these two books.
2,Neelam N,The book is good in clearing concepts,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 8 December 2016,"  The book is good in clearing concepts. The author has presented the topics in a very  lucid language. There were more than a couple of mistakes in the book and that gave me an opportunity to interact with the author. I must say, the author was prompt enough to acknowledge them and replied to all my questions and suggestion. Talking about the pros of the book, it neatly explains the concept and logic required to solve the questions along with the weightage and difficulty of each question asked in paper 1.  At the end of every chapter, it enlists a set of 10 problems for self assessment. It also has model question papers for practice. Talking about the cons , there aren't many except that a few more practice questions at the end of the chapters would have been helpful."
3,honest reviews,"Great Book, Very helpful, Make use of the App also",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 1 April 2016,"  This is a really great book. It has all the previous questions answered from Dec 2012. Detailed solutions, careful and exhaustive selection of topics are the uniqueness of the book. Most of the possible topics for aptitude test are covered. A few problems a day for 5-6 months can do wonders in the NET exam. The android app shows the commitment of the publishers/author towards helping the students."
4,Amazon Customer,Good book but many printing mistakes,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 15 June 2020,"  First of all thank you amazon for delivering the book in the said time during this lockdown period. The book was delivered in a very proper packaging with very good condition of the book. The book is good for preparing CSIR NET paper I (however, just completed first chapter only), but the book has plenty of printing mistakes which needs correction. Also in some places the explanation is not clear. But overall its a decent book for preparation of CSIR NET common paper."

7,Priyal Sharma,Go for it!,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 20 April 2018,"  Great book. Very concise yet very articulate. Everything has been explained in a lucid manner. Of note, there are no short tricks but the way the problems have been approached is quite easily understandable. Worth mentioning are the chaoters in which the entire syllabus has been divided by the author. Great effort!! üëçüëç"
